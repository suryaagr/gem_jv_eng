                <p>The fundamental human problem is that we live in a state of <strong class="term-tooltip" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="The state of consciousness where the Self primarily operates based on sensory gratification and survival.">Animal Consciousness (`Jeev Chetna`)</strong>. In this state, only 4.5 of our 10 innate conscious activities are fully functional, primarily oriented toward survival and sensory gratification.

                <p>In the state of Animal Consciousness, our experience is dominated by the activities of three faculties:</p>

                <p>The key to transitioning from conflict to harmony lies in shifting the basis of our evaluation—our <span class="term-tooltip" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Perspective or worldview; the lens through which one evaluates reality.">perspective (`drishti`)</span>.</p>
                <hr>
                <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Explanation</h6>
                <p>In Animal Consciousness, our perspectives are limited and self-centered. In Human Consciousness, they become universal and conducive to mutual fulfillment.</p>
                <p>We must shift from limited perspectives (Likes/Dislikes, Profit/Loss, Sensation/Health) to resolved perspectives (<span class="term-tooltip" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="The recognition and fulfillment of values in human-to-human relationships, leading to mutual happiness.">Justice</span>, <span class="term-tooltip" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="The intrinsic nature of a unit that ensures its integrity and participation in the larger order.">Order</span>, <span class="term-tooltip" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="The understanding of reality as it is, as coexistence.">Truth</span>).</p>
                <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Example</h6>
                <p class="card-text">A marriage might be judged "successful" from a limited perspective based on its form—a lavish ceremony. However, its true success, evaluated from a resolved perspective, depends on the substance of the relationship: mutual understanding and harmonious behavior.</p>
                <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Short Rule / Tip</h6>
                <p class="card-text">Consciously shift your internal frame of reference from self-centered preferences to a universal understanding of harmony.</p>
